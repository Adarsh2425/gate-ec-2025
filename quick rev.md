This guide is structured like a complete book to help you ace the GATE EC exam. It includes formulas, problem-solving techniques, illustrative examples, and exam tips.

üìö **1. Engineering Mathematics - Advanced**

**Linear Algebra - Enhanced**

*   **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors Deep Dive**
    *   **Properties of Eigenvalues:**
        *   Sum of eigenvalues = Trace(A)
        *   Product of eigenvalues = det(A)
        *   For a triangular or diagonal matrix, eigenvalues are the diagonal elements.
        *   If Œª is an eigenvalue of A, then kŒª is an eigenvalue of kA.
        *   If Œª is an eigenvalue of A, then Œª‚Åø is an eigenvalue of A‚Åø.
        *   If Œª is an eigenvalue of A, then 1/Œª is an eigenvalue of A‚Åª¬π (if A‚Åª¬π exists).
    *   **Cayley-Hamilton Theorem:** Every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation.  Can be used to calculate matrix inverses and powers.
    *   **Diagonalization:** If a matrix A has n linearly independent eigenvectors, it can be diagonalized as  P‚Åª¬πAP = D, where D is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and P is a matrix of eigenvectors.

    **Example Question 1: Eigenvalues & Trace**
    ```
    The sum of the eigenvalues of a 3x3 matrix is 6, and the product of the eigenvalues is also 6. If one eigenvalue is 2, what are the other eigenvalues?
    ```
    **Solution:**
    *   **Thought Process:**
        1.  Recall that for a matrix, the sum of eigenvalues is equal to the trace, and the product of eigenvalues is equal to the determinant.
        2.  Let the eigenvalues be Œª‚ÇÅ, Œª‚ÇÇ, Œª‚ÇÉ. We are given Œª‚ÇÅ + Œª‚ÇÇ + Œª‚ÇÉ = 6, Œª‚ÇÅŒª‚ÇÇŒª‚ÇÉ = 6, and Œª‚ÇÅ = 2.
        3.  Substitute Œª‚ÇÅ = 2 into the sum and product equations:
            *   2 + Œª‚ÇÇ + Œª‚ÇÉ = 6  =>  Œª‚ÇÇ + Œª‚ÇÉ = 4
            *   2 * Œª‚ÇÇ * Œª‚ÇÉ = 6  =>  Œª‚ÇÇŒª‚ÇÉ = 3
        4.  Now we have a system of two equations for two variables. Solve for Œª‚ÇÇ and Œª‚ÇÉ. We can use the quadratic formula by considering a quadratic equation with roots Œª‚ÇÇ and Œª‚ÇÉ:  x¬≤ - (Œª‚ÇÇ + Œª‚ÇÉ)x + Œª‚ÇÇŒª‚ÇÉ = 0
        5.  Substitute the sums and products: x¬≤ - 4x + 3 = 0
        6.  Factor the quadratic equation: (x - 3)(x - 1) = 0
        7.  The roots are x = 3 and x = 1. Therefore, the other eigenvalues are 3 and 1.

    *   **Answer:** The other eigenvalues are 1 and 3.

    ```
    Solve the differential equation dy/dt + 2y = e‚Åª·µó , given y(0) = 1 using Laplace Transform.
    ```
    **Solution:**
    *   **Thought Process:**
        1.  Recognize this is a linear first-order differential equation with an initial condition, making Laplace transform a good approach.
        2.  Apply Laplace transform to both sides of the DE. Recall:
            *   L{dy/dt} = sY(s) - y(0)
            *   L{e‚Åª·µó} = 1/(s + 1)
            *   L{y} = Y(s)
        3.  Transform the equation: [sY(s) - y(0)] + 2Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)
        4.  Substitute the initial condition y(0) = 1: sY(s) - 1 + 2Y(s) = 1/(s + 1)
        5.  Algebraically solve for Y(s):
            *   Y(s)(s + 2) = 1 + 1/(s + 1) = (s + 1 + 1)/(s + 1) = (s + 2)/(s + 1)
            *   Y(s) = (s + 2) / [(s + 1)(s + 2)] = 1/(s + 1)
        6.  Take the inverse Laplace transform of Y(s) to find y(t).
            *   L‚Åª¬π{1/(s + 1)} = e‚Åª·µó

    *   **Answer:** y(t) = e‚Åª·µó

```
Find the Thevenin equivalent circuit for the network shown, with respect to terminals A and B. The circuit contains a dependent voltage source.
```
   *(Assume a circuit diagram would be here, depicting a network with resistors, independent source and a voltage-controlled voltage source)*

    **Solution:**
    *   **Thought Process:**
        1.  Identify the presence of a dependent source. The standard method of deactivating sources to find R_th alone doesn't directly apply to dependent sources.
        2.  **Method to find R_th with dependent sources:**
            *   Calculate Open Circuit Voltage (V_oc) at A-B.
            *   Calculate Short Circuit Current (I_sc) at A-B.
            *   R_th = V_oc / I_sc
        3.  **Calculate V_oc:**  Open terminals A-B and analyze the circuit to find the voltage across A-B. Use KVL/KCL as necessary, treating the dependent source like any other circuit element in the analysis.
        4.  **Calculate I_sc:** Short circuit terminals A-B and analyze the circuit to find the current flowing through the short circuit. Again, use KVL/KCL, remembering to account for the dependent source's behavior under short circuit conditions.
        5.  **Calculate R_th and assemble Thevenin equivalent.**

        *(Assume after steps 3 & 4 and circuit analysis using KVL/KCL, we find V_oc = 10V and I_sc = 2A)*

    *   **Answer:**  R_th = V_oc / I_sc = 10V / 2A = 5Œ©. The Thevenin equivalent is a 10V voltage source in series with a 5Œ© resistor. *(Circuit Diagram of Thevenin equivalent to be visualized or drawn).*

```

    **Solution:**

        2.  Determine the overdrive voltage V_OV = V_GS - V_th = 2V - 1V = 1V.
        3.  Check the region of operation for each V_DS case:

            *   **Triode Region:** V_DS < V_OV = 1V
            *   **Saturation Region:** V_DS ‚â• V_OV = 1V
        4.  Apply the appropriate I_D equation for each V_DS value:
            *   **(a) V_DS = 0.5V (Triode):**
                *   I_D = k_n [2(V_GS - V_th)V_DS - V_DS¬≤] = 0.5mA/V¬≤ [2(1V)(0.5V) - (0.5V)¬≤] = 0.5mA/V¬≤ [1V¬≤ - 0.25V¬≤] = 0.5mA/V¬≤ * 0.75V¬≤ = 0.375mA

            *   **(c) V_DS = 2.5V (Saturation):**

A discrete-time LTI system is described by the difference equation: y[n] - 0.5y[n-1] = x[n]
(a) Find the frequency response H(e^(jœâ)).
(b) Is the system stable?
```

    **Solution:**
    *   **Thought Process:**
        1.  Recognize this is a difference equation for a discrete-time LTI system.  To find frequency response, use the DTFT.
        2.  Take DTFT of both sides of the difference equation. Recall the time-shifting property of DTFT: x[n-k] ‚Üî e^(-jœâk)X(e^(jœâ)).
        3.  Applying DTFT: Y(e^(jœâ)) - 0.5e^(-jœâ)Y(e^(jœâ)) = X(e^(jœâ))
        4.  Solve for the frequency response H(e^(jœâ)) = Y(e^(jœâ)) / X(e^(jœâ)):
            *   H(e^(jœâ)) = Y(e^(jœâ)) / X(e^(jœâ)) = 1 / [1 - 0.5e^(-jœâ)]

        5.  **For stability:** Examine the pole location in the z-domain. Convert H(e^(jœâ)) back to H(z) by replacing e^(jœâ) with z:
            *   H(z) = 1 / [1 - 0.5z‚Åª¬π] = 1 / [(z - 0.5)/z] = z / (z - 0.5)
            *   The pole is at z = 0.5.

        6.  **Stability condition in z-domain:** System is stable if all poles are inside the unit circle (|z| < 1).
            *   Here, |0.5| < 1.  Therefore, the system is stable.

    *   **Answer:**
        *   (a) H(e^(jœâ)) = 1 / [1 - 0.5e^(-jœâ)]
        *   (b) Yes, the system is stable.

**Example Question 7:  Digital Modulation - QPSK and Constellation**

```
In a QPSK system, the input bit stream is divided into pairs.  If the input bit rate is 10 Mbps,
(a) What is the symbol rate?
(b) Sketch the constellation diagram for QPSK, clearly labeling each point with its corresponding bit pair.
```

    **Solution:**
    *   **Thought Process:**
        1.  Understand QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying):  It transmits 2 bits per symbol by using 4 different phases.
        2.  **Symbol rate calculation:** Since 2 bits are transmitted per symbol, the symbol rate will be half the bit rate.
        3.  **QPSK Constellation:** Recall QPSK uses 4 phases, equally spaced 90¬∞ apart. Standard phase assignments for Gray coding (to minimize bit errors):
            *   00, 01, 11, 10

    *   **Calculations & Constellation Diagram:**
        *   (a) Symbol Rate = Bit Rate / Bits per Symbol = 10 Mbps / 2 = 5 MSps (Mega Symbols per second).

        *   (b) **QPSK Constellation Diagram (Approximation - Markdown Text based):**

            ```
              Imaginary
               ^
               |
         01 *   * 11  <-- Points in Complex Plane (Amplitude assumed constant)
               |
         -----*-----*----> Real
               |
         00 *   * 10
               |

            (Points are ideally at equal distance from origin and 90¬∞ apart)
            (Specific phase assignment might vary slightly based on convention, but spacing is key)
            ```

    *   **Answer:**
        *   (a) Symbol rate = 5 MSps
        *   (b) Constellation diagram sketched as above (visualize or sketch a more precise diagram).
